# StoryBot Remake
super rushed but works  
original by Dzeni

## Usage
git clone  
copy `config.example.json` as `config.json` and put in your token, client id and test guild id (optional)  
run `node deploy-commands.js` (no need to do this every time, only when commands are updated)  
run `node .`  
poof now you have storybot

## Contributing
when adding/editing wordlists make sure line endings are LF (not CRLF!) and there are no empty lines
